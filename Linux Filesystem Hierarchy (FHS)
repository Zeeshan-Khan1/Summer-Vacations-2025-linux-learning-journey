- Linux organizes files and folders in a **tree structure** starting from the root `/`.
- Paths are case-sensitive and separated by `/`.
- Important commands for navigation:
  1. pwd` → Shows the current folder path.
  2. cd [directory]` → Change to a different folder.
  3. tree -d -L 1 /` → Shows the top-level folders in the root directory.

Some Important Directories:
- `/root` or `/home/username` → Home directories
- `/bin`, `/usr/bin` → User programs
- `/sbin`, `/usr/sbin` → System programs
- `/etc` → Configuration files
- `/tmp` → Temporary files
- `/usr` → Application files
- `/boot` → Kernel and boot files
- `/var`, `/srv` → Server data
- `/proc`, `/sys` → System information
- `/lib`, `/usr/lib` → Shared libraries
- `/media`, `/mnt` → Mount points for other drives
