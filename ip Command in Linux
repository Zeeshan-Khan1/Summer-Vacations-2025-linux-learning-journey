The ip command is used to show, configure, and manage networking (IP addresses, routes, interfaces, etc.).

✅ Common ip Command Examples:

Check IP address of your system

ip addr show


or short form:

ip a


👉 Shows all network interfaces and their IP addresses.

Show only IPv4 addresses

ip -4 addr


Show only IPv6 addresses

ip -6 addr


Check only one interface (example: eth0)

ip addr show dev eth0


Show routing table (how packets are sent/received)

ip route show


👉 Similar to route -n.

Assign a new IP address to an interface

sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0


Remove an IP address from interface

sudo ip addr del 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0


Bring a network interface up/down

sudo ip link set eth0 up
sudo ip link set eth0 down

📝 In Short:

ip addr → show IP addresses

ip route → show routing table

ip link → show/manage interfaces

ip addr add/del → assign/remove IPs
