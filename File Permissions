sudo Explained in Simple Words
sudo (short for "SuperUser DO") is like getting admin powers for a single command.

What It Does:
Lets you run commands as the root user (the boss of the system).

Needed for tasks like:

Installing software (sudo apt install)

Editing system files (sudo nano /etc/file)

Changing permissions (sudo chmod)

Example:
bash
sudo apt update
This updates your package list with admin rights.

How to Use It:
Type sudo before any command needing admin access.

Enter your password (not the root password).
