In Linux, path completion means you donâ€™t need to type the full folder or file name. You just type the first few letters and press Tab, and the system will complete the rest for you.

Example:
Instead of typing cd ntp/, you can type cd nt + Tab, and it will auto-complete to cd ntp/.

# Path Completion Example
cd /etc/      # move to /etc directory
cd nt<Tab>    # press Tab after typing 'nt'

Output:

cd ntp/
