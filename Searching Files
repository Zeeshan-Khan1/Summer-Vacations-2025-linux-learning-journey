find → Searches files and directories in real-time by scanning the file system.
Example:

find /home -name file.txt


→ Looks for file.txt inside /home.

locate → Searches files quickly using a pre-built database (faster than find).
Example:

locate file.txt


→ Instantly shows all paths where file.txt exists.
