Absolute Path

An absolute path gives the full location of a file or directory starting from the root directory /.

It always starts with /.

Example:

/home/zeeshan/Documents/file.txt
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf


No matter where you are in the system, this path will always point to the same file.

ðŸ”¹ Relative Path

A relative path describes the location of a file or directory relative to your current working directory (pwd).

It does not start with /.

Example (suppose you are in /home/zeeshan):

Documents/file.txt     â†’ refers to /home/zeeshan/Documents/file.txt
./file.txt             â†’ current directoryâ€™s file
../Pictures/image.png  â†’ one folder up, then go to Pictures/image.png
