What is tmux?

tmux stands for Terminal Multiplexer.
It is a Linux/Unix tool that lets you run multiple terminal sessions inside a single window and keep them running even if you close your terminal or get disconnected.

Think of it like tabs and split screens for your terminal.

ðŸ”¹ Why use tmux?

Run multiple sessions in one terminal.

Detach and reattach to sessions (your work keeps running in the background).

Split windows into panes (horizontal & vertical).

Useful for remote servers (via SSH) where you donâ€™t want your processes to stop if your internet disconnects.

ðŸ”¹ Common tmux Commands
Start a new session
tmux

Start a new session with a name
tmux new -s mysession

Detach from session (leave it running)

Ctrl + b  d

List all sessions

ðŸ”¹ Splitting Windows into Panes
